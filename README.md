	This is a project who covers the basics of HTML and CSS.
 	This helped me a lot to understand the concepts of both while studying in The Odin Project (www.theodinproject.com).
 	At first I had some pretty hard time applying attributes, but I looked up on google, used dev tools and saw some other student's resolution.
 	This is my first finished project while studying web development.

 	Thanks!
